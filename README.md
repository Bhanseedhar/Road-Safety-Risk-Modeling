## Project Overview
This repository contains a machine learning pipeline for predicting road accident risk at the postcode level, designed to assist insurance companies in risk assessment, pricing optimization, and loss mitigation. By analyzing historical accident data, weather conditions, road infrastructure, and traffic patterns, this model generates granular risk scores that enable insurers to:

- Improve underwriting accuracy
- Optimize premium pricing
- Reduce claims frequency & severity
- Develop data-driven safety initiatives

---

## Key Features
✔ Geospatial Risk Scoring - Predicts accident likelihood per postcode
✔ Temporal Analysis - Identifies high-risk times (hourly/weekly/seasonal trends)
✔ Feature Engineering - Encodes road types, weather, traffic, and infrastructure factors
✔ Model-Ready Data - Structured for machine learning (classification/regression)
✔ Interpretability - Highlights key risk contributors (e.g., poor lighting, high-speed zones)

## Insurance Applications
| Use Case | Business Impact |
|----------|----------------|
| Dynamic Pricing | Adjust premiums based on localized risk rather than broad regions |
| Portfolio Optimization | Balance high/low-risk policy distribution |
| Claims Forecasting | Predict claim likelihood and severity per area |
| Preventive Risk Mitigation | Recommend safety measures for high-risk zones |
| Telematics Integration | Enhance usage-based insurance (UBI) with road risk data |

---

## Data Sources
- UK Road Accident Data (date, time, location, severity)
- Road Infrastructure (speed limits, road type, traffic signals)
- Weather Conditions (visibility, precipitation, surface conditions)
- Postcode-Geographic Mapping (urban/rural classification, authority districts)

---

## Technical Implementation
### Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- Feature Engineering (Frequency Encoding, Temporal Decomposition)
- Machine Learning (XGBoost, Random Forest, Logistic Regression)

### Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing - Missing value handling, outlier removal
2. Feature Extraction - Time-based, geospatial, and road-condition features
3. Model Training - Risk prediction at postcode level
4. Risk Scoring - Assigns probability scores for accidents

---

## Installation & Usage
### 1. Clone Repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/RoadSafetyRiskModeling.git
cd RoadSafetyRiskModeling

### 2. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

### 3. Run Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook main.ipynb

### 4. Generate Risk Predictions
from model import RiskPredictor  
predictor = RiskPredictor()  
risk_scores = predictor.evaluate_postcode("OX3 9UP")

## Future Enhancements
- Real-Time Risk Updates (API integration with traffic/weather feeds)
- Deep Learning Model (CNN for satellite image-based risk assessment)
- Interactive Dashboard (Visualize high-risk zones)
- Telematics Integration (Driver behavior + road risk correlation)
